# Instructions for use

- Click on buttons on top of screen to play either song.

# How it works 

Game starts automatically as well as the first background.
Press either button to play a song. the backgrounds change sizes, colours with the song.

# A list of the stuff you are most proud of?

- We really helped each other. We were all had different levels of understanding  programming. So we worked together in Discord, sharing screens and using voice chat. 
- Adapting code from class.
- Following tutorials from Danial Stiffman to get the Fractorial Tree working.
- Setting up classes for the bricks and ball, being able to work with variables from one "class" to the another (collision code).

Mark:
I am personally most proud of how much I was able to programme together and make for this assignment. I personally struggle when it comes to coding and I find it very difficult to come up with and alter code. It was a massive achievement for me to of produced the background that I did. I also briefly learnt how to manage song files and got to use my own song for my background. It was a lot of fun to think up of a composition and then go and make it. I was shown specific pieces of code that let me multiply the scaling of the shapes and was a very satisfying experience.
