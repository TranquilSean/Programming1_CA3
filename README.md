# Project Description

A mini Game to play while listening to a choice of songs, with some visual backgrounds.

# Instructions for use

- A & D to Move the player/paddle
- 1, 2, and 3 to switch between backgrounds
- Click on buttons on top of screen to play either song.

# How it works 

Game starts automatically as well as the first background.
Press either button to play a song. the backgrounds change sizes, colours with the song.

# A list of the stuff you are most proud of?

- We really helped each other. We were all had different levels of understanding  programming. So we worked together in Discord, sharing screens and using voice chat. 
- Adapting code from class.
- Following tutorials from Danial Stiffman to get the Fractorial Tree working.
- Setting up classes for the bricks and ball, being able to work with variables from one "class" to the another (collision code).

### Mark:

I am personally most proud of how much I was able to programme together and make for this assignment. I personally struggle when it comes to coding and I find it very difficult to come up with and alter code. It was a massive achievement for me to of produced the background that I did. I also briefly learnt how to manage song files and got to use my own song for my background. It was a lot of fun to think up of a composition and then go and make it. I was shown specific pieces of code that let me multiply the scaling of the shapes and was a very satisfying experience.

### Niamh:

When we first started making sketches in class that reacted to music, I struggled with it a lot, but I finally understand how to make the sketches work and the logic behind them. I believe this marks a great personal achievement as I personally struggle with coding but being able to code my background with as many shapes and changing colours as I did has been a great academic accomplishment for me.

### Sean:

Challenged myself to learn about classes and arrays, and how to make the different classes interact with each other. 
The colour wheel, i always struggled with trig, so getting the circle points and lines working was a pround moment.

## What each team member did ?

### Mark:

In my sketch, I used 3D shapes, push matrixes and translates to make the sphere and cubes, variables, for loops and map function for the rainbow-coloured framing. I used the map function to set the range of colours for the frame. And I used minim to implement the songs
After the team agreed on what type of sketch we wanted to make, I began designing a background. After I showed it to the team, they then got involved and implemented other types of code to come out with a better result.

I wrote some of the documentation for the project and helped the others when they needed it.

### Niamh:

My sketch uses minim so that the leaves and frame react to the music by changing colour and size as well in the frameâ€™s case, translates to move to the end of branches so a new branch could be drawn, push and pop matrixes to deliver branch commands and then reset to a previous branch and draw it again using different variables, rotates to change what direction they were facing, if statements to draw the leaves after a certain variable had been met, for loops to create the buffer and the map function to determine the range of colours. After we decided on what type of sketch, we wanted to make I began planning my background. When we held another meeting and we displayed what each of us had done we began editing. I also had a part in writing this document.

Buttons to to switch between songs and made a playlists..

The brick breaker game.

The cirlce/lines visual.
